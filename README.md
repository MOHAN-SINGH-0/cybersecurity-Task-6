 ## What I Learned

- Password strength increases with **length**, **complexity**, and **unpredictability**.
- Just add an **_** in 3rd example Changed the score to **Medium** to **Strong**, that means using Special Sybols Make a Password Storng
- Similarly Just Adding **23** after **_** Makes Password **very Strong** 
- Using **passphrases** or mixing symbols and cases makes passwords much harder to crack.
- Short, simple passwords—even with numbers—are still easy to guess.

## Tip 
The  5th Password (MoHaN@0603_21) is still very weak and could be crack is seconds, Although this password was marked as “Very Strong” by the online password checker, the reason website show is Very Strong is because website dont have any Infomartion about the user, and the reason i am saying this is because that password only contains 
- MoHaN: My Name
- 0603:  my Date of Birth
- 21: my current age.

Now you see What i am saying The password looked random to the tool, but to a hacker who knows basic personal details (name, birthday, age, etc.), it would be much easier to guess or include in a targeted brute-force/dictionary attack.

So, even a “Very Strong” password is actually weak if it includes predictable, personal patterns.
